When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I was working remotely or when I want to share the work I've done

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I want to control what is actually in my local project

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Use fork to copy someone elses repository in Git Hub, use clone to copy a repository either locally or in Git Hub. Branches to establish new code.
